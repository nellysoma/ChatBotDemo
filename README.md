# ChatBotDemo
Just used this project to learn how to build chatbots, I used the Java implementation of AIML  Ab.jar. wired it to a servlet. a html form sends query to the servlet which passes Ab.jar Bot and Chat classes. Also created a custom AIML file logistics.aiml the chat bot is supposed to answer logistics related questions. i like drawing UML diagrams sorry.
